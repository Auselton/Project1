Alex Uselton,
Creating a website for Snuggles and Bubbles Childcare.
Website will provide all of the contact information and have a form to collect applicants information.
Technolgies used are .HTML, .CSS and Bootstrap.
For future improvement I would like to be able to fill more of the blank spaces. I want to add more features to the pages. Finally I would like to be able to add more details to sections.
